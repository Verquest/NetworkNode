# NetworkNode
A program that simulates a distributed network of servers each with a set of resources. Clients can request resource allocation, the network will check 
for availability of the resources, allocating them if they're available or notifying the client about the lack of aforementioned resources. New nodes can
be added with a specified amount of resources.
